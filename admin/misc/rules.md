## Primary Means of Communication and Execution

All team members are expected to check Slack daily and respond within 24 hours.
Discord will be used for purposes requiring video and voice communication.

## Scheduling Meetings

Team members will take turns sending out a reminder of the meeting with an agenda within eight hours after the class. At least one meeting will be held every week, and a when2meet will always be sent out prior to meeting time finalization.

## General Responsibilities for All Team Members

  1. Update GitHub boards such that it is always an accurate representation of what you’re working on and at what stage the issue is on
  2. Maintain active communication and check Slack daily
  3. Reach out and communicate with other team members (or leads) if you need help with the issue or something else comes up
  4. Depending on your task and designated work partner(s), check in actively with each other for accountability and progress updates
  5. Take on tasks within reason and set personal deadlines or estimated time of completion for the team to stay updated with your progress

## Conflict Resolution
- Strike 1: Bring it up in team meeting / Slack [^1]
  [^1]:Potentially re-assign the task to another team member
- Strike 2: Leads talk to them privately and try to figure out what’s wrong
- Strike 3: Talk to the TA about it

## Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s

If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
